# MARC Liberation

Liberate MARC data from Voyager.

## Configuration

Be sure to copy `config/voyager_helpers.yml.tmpl` to `config/voyager_helpers.yml`
and fill out the appropriate values.

## Installation

Oci8 is a little bit of a pain. See `/voyager_helpers/README.md` for details.

## Services

For now look at `config/routes.rb` for what's available.

## License

See `LICENSE`.
