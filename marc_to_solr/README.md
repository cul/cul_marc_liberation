Index configuration for PUL and rake tasks for Solr Indexing
=====================================

Run tests with `rspec`

Versions:
* JRuby 1.7.23
* Traject 2.1.0

**Note**: The Traject functionality can also be called within MarcLiberation.
There is a second Gemfile in this directory to allow the indexing tasks to
run on JRuby, which allows for multi-threaded processing.
